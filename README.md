A component library with a look inspired by the technicality and sophistication found inside an aircraft cockpit/flight deck. Propulsion UI is originally built to standardise the components across my projects. Created using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
